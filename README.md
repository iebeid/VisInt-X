# VisInt-X
VisInt-X is a developed visualization for the file produced by the XLPM algorithm. It is developed using JavaScript on HTML5 by definition. It uses several JavaScript pre developed libraries like: d3js, taffy and jquery. It is based on getting inputs from the user, the 2 inputs are the files that the visualization will be based on, and producing three layers of visualizations according to user click input that will be demonstrated later.
